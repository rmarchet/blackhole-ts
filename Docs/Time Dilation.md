## Introduction

The image above shows a simulated black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. The bright ring and the warped appearance of the disk are caused by the intense gravity of the black hole bending the paths of light—a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. This effect allows us to see parts of the disk that would otherwise be hidden behind the black hole.

While the image powerfully illustrates spatial effects of general relativity, such as lensing and the warping of light, it does not directly show time dilation. However, the same extreme gravity that bends light also causes time to pass more slowly near the black hole—a phenomenon known as gravitational time dilation.

## What is Time Dilation?

In regions with stronger gravity, time passes more slowly compared to regions with weaker gravity. The relationship between proper time ($\tau$) and coordinate time ($t$) in a gravitational field is:

$$\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}$$

Where:
- $\tau$ is proper time (experienced by an observer in the gravitational field)
- $t$ is coordinate time (experienced by a distant observer)
- $G$ is the gravitational constant
- $M$ is the mass of the gravitating body
- $r$ is the radial distance from the center
- $c$ is the speed of light

## Time Dilation Near Black Holes

As an observer approaches a black hole's event horizon, time appears to slow down from a distant observer's perspective. At the event horizon itself, time dilation becomes infinite - time appears to stop completely.

For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the time dilation factor is given by the equation above. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the formula is more complex and depends on both mass and angular momentum.

## Why It's Not Visible in Our Simulation

Our simulation and the image above do not directly visualize time dilation for several reasons:

1. **Perspective**: The simulation is rendered from a distant observer's viewpoint, showing gravitational lensing but not time dilation itself.

2. **Technical limitations**: Visualizing time dilation requires complex relativistic calculations beyond our current scope.

3. **Representation challenges**: Time dilation is a temporal effect, while our simulation is primarily spatial.

4. **Animation simplification**:
The animation of the black hole shows the accretion disk to move with a constant speed. Time dilation should make the internal part of the disk slower than the external part.


## Indirect Observable Effects

While not directly visualized, time dilation produces observable effects:

1. **Gravitational redshift**: Light from regions of strong gravity appears redshifted due to time dilation affecting wave frequency.

2. **Frame dragging**: In rotating black holes, spacetime is dragged along with rotation, related to time dilation.

3. **Accretion disk appearance**: Material closer to the black hole appears to move more slowly due to time dilation.
