# Photon Ring

The **photon ring** is a bright, thin ring of light that appears around a black hole's shadow. It is formed by photons that orbit the black hole multiple times before escaping to a distant observer, due to the extreme curvature of spacetime.

## Photon Sphere

The photon ring is closely related to the **photon sphere**â€”the spherical region where gravity is strong enough that photons can travel in unstable circular orbits.

For a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole, the photon sphere radius is:
```math
r_{\text{ph}} = 1.5 \, r_s = 3M
```
where $r_s = 2M$ is the Schwarzschild radius and $M$ is the black hole mass.

For a rotating (Kerr) black hole, the photon sphere radius depends on the spin $a$ and the direction of photon motion (prograde or retrograde):
```math
r_{\text{ph}}^{\pm} = 2M \left\{ 1 + \cos\left[ \frac{2}{3} \arccos\left( \mp \frac{a}{M} \right) \right] \right\}
```
- $r_{\text{ph}}^{+}$: prograde (co-rotating) photons
- $r_{\text{ph}}^{-}$: retrograde (counter-rotating) photons

## Apparent Size of the Photon Ring

The apparent angular radius of the photon ring as seen by a distant observer is:
```math
\theta_{\text{ph}} = \arcsin \left( \frac{b_{\text{ph}}}{D} \right)
```
where:
- $b_{\text{ph}}$ is the critical impact parameter for photon orbits,
- $D$ is the distance from the observer to the black hole.

For a Schwarzschild black hole:
```math
b_{\text{ph}} = \frac{r_{\text{ph}}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2M}{r_{\text{ph}}}}}
```

## Physical Significance

- The photon ring is a direct consequence of general relativity and is a key observable in black hole imaging (e.g., the Event Horizon Telescope).
- Its shape and size encode information about the black hole's mass and spin.
